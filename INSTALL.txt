Installing PEAK 

 PEAK Release 0.5 alpha 1

 Copyright (C) 1996-2002 by Phillip J. Eby and Tyler C. Sarna.
 All rights reserved.  This software may be used under the same terms
 as Zope or Python.  THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.
 Code quality varies between modules, from "beta" to "experimental
 pre-alpha".  :)


 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

  Basic installation requires Python 2.2.1, and the Zope 'Interface' package.
  If you want to run the test suite or use any of PEAK's frameworks
  (e.g. database interaction, UML/XMI processing, etc.), you will also need
  Aaron Watters' 'kjbuckets' library for your version of Python.  See
  "Obtaining and Installing Dependencies" below if you do not already have
  the 'Interface' package or the 'kjbuckets' module.

  Note: if you have installed previous versions of PEAK or TransWarp, be
  sure to remove them before installing this one.  A lot of things have
  moved, been removed, or just plain ain't the same.


 BASIC INSTALLATION

  PEAK is distributed using the now-standard Python 'distutils' protocol.
  Just unpack the archive, go to the directory containing 'setup.py', and run::

    python setup.py install

  PEAK will be installed in the 'site-packages' directory of your Python
  installation.  (Unless directed elsewhere; see the "Installing Python 
  Modules" section of the Python manuals for details on customizing
  installation locations, etc.).





 THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE INCLUDED WITH PEAK

  Aaron Watters' 'kjbuckets' Module

   PEAK now includes a copy of Aaron Watters' 'kjbuckets' module for
   your convenience, and automatically installs it alongside PEAK in
   your Python 'site-packages' directory.  (Note that this will overwrite
   any existing installation of the 'kjbuckets' module.)

   'kjbuckets' is copyright Aaron Watters and contributors; please see
   the 'src/kjbuckets/COPYRIGHT.txt' file for details of its license.


  The Zope 3 'Interface' and 'Persistence' Packages

   PEAK now includes a copy of the Zope 3 'Interface' package, and a portion
   of the Zope 3 'Persistence' package.  They are automatically installed
   alongside PEAK in your 'site-packages' directory, unless you specify an
   alternate installation location to 'setup.py'.  (Note that this will
   overwrite any existing installation of these packages.)  The 'Interface'
   and 'Persistence' packages are copyright Zope Corporation and Contributors;
   please see the 'LICENSE.txt' files in each directory for details.


















   
 TESTING YOUR INSTALLATION

  PEAK comes with a moderately-sized built-in test suite.  If you wish to
  run it after installation, you can do so like this::

   python setup.py test

  This will run about 27 tests on various parts of PEAK.  If you have
  installed everything correctly, 100% of the tests should succeed.  If
  you're missing any needed parts, you will probably be unable to run the
  tests at all.

  If you'd like to run only a portion of the test suite, you can supply
  the '--test-module' or '-m' option to the test command as follows::

    python setup.py test --test-module=peak.util.tests

    python setup.py test -m peak.tests

  And so on.  You can also use 'python setup.py -q test' to make the tests
  run more "quietly".

  By default, 'python setup.py test' only runs 'peak.api.tests', which cover
  the basic, currently supported functionality of PEAK.  If you specify
  the 'peak.tests' module (as in the second example above), the full 67-test
  suite will be run.  These tests will take longer to run, as they perform
  some rather complex XMI and UUID tests.
