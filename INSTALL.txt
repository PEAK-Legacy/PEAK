Installing TransWarp 

 TransWarp Release 0.2 preview 1

  Copyright (C) 2001,2002 by Phillip J. Eby, All rights reserved.
  This software may be used under the same terms as Zope or Python.
  THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.  Code quality varies
  from "alpha" to "experimental pre-alpha".  :)


 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

  Basic installation requires Python 2.2, and the Zope 'Interface' package.
  If you want to run the test suite or use any of TransWarp's frameworks
  (e.g. database interaction, UML/XMI processing, etc.), you will also need
  Aaron Watters' 'kjbuckets' library for your version of Python.  See
  "Obtaining and Installing Dependencies" below if you do not already have
  the 'Interface' package or the 'kjbuckets' module.

  Note: if you have installed previous versions of TransWarp, be sure to
  remove them before installing this one.  A lot of things have moved,
  been removed, or just plain ain't the same.


 BASIC INSTALLATION

  TransWarp is distributed using the now-standard Python 'distutils' protocol.
  Just unpack the archive, go to the directory containing 'setup.py', and run::

    python setup.py install

  TransWarp will be installed in the "site-packages" directory of your Python
  installation.  (Unless directed elsewhere; see the "Installing Python 
  Modules" section of the Python manuals for details on customizing
  installation locations, etc.).


 OBTAINING AND INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES

  Aaron Watters' 'kjbuckets' Module

   See "http://phd.pp.ru/Software/Python/#kjbuckets":http://phd.pp.ru/Software/Python/#kjbuckets
   for information on downloading and installing kjbuckets for various
   platforms and versions of Python.  Note that if you're on Windows, all you
   need to do is copy the '2.2/kjbuckets.pyd' to
   '/Python22/Lib/site-packages/kjbuckets.pyd', and you're done.  On other
   platforms, install as you would any other Python module, with::

    python setup.py install

   Note: if you aren't on Windows, and for some reason can't compile the
   kjbuckets module, you can as a last resort download this file:

     "http://www.chordate.com/kwParsing/kjbuckets0.py":http://www.chordate.com/kwParsing/kjbuckets0.py

   Rename it to "kjbuckets.py", and place it in your Python path.  This runs
   slower than the C version, but it'll do in a pinch.
 

  The Zope 'Interface' Package

   The easiest place to find a copy of the Interface package is in the
   'lib/python' directory of a Zope installation.  Just copy it over to your
   main Python path, or add the 'lib/python' directory to your Python path.

   Failing that, you can download a copy direct from Zope.org's CVS repository:

    "http://cvs.zope.org/Packages/Interface/Interface.tar.gz?tarball=1":http://cvs.zope.org/Packages/Interface/Interface.tar.gz?tarball=1


 TESTING YOUR INSTALLATION

  TransWarp comes with a moderately-sized built-in test suite.  If you wish to
  run it after installation, you can do so like this::

   python setup.py test

  This will run about 75 tests on various parts of TransWarp.  If you have
  installed everything correctly, 100% of the tests should succeed.  If
  you're missing any needed parts, you will probably be unable to run the
  tests at all.

  If you'd like to run only a portion of the test suite, you can supply
  the '--test-module' or '-m' option to the test command as follows::

    python setup.py test --test-module=TW.Database.tests

    python setup.py test -m TW.API.tests

  And so on.  You can also use 'python setup.py -q test' to make the tests
  run more "quietly".
