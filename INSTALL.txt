Installing PEAK 

 PEAK Release 0.5 alpha 1

 Copyright (C) 1996-2002 by Phillip J. Eby and Tyler C. Sarna.
 All rights reserved.  This software may be used under the same terms
 as Zope or Python.  THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.
 Code quality varies between modules, from "beta" to "experimental
 pre-alpha".  :)


 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

  Basic installation requires Python 2.2.1, and the Zope 'Interface' package.
  If you want to run the test suite or use any of PEAK's frameworks
  (e.g. database interaction, UML/XMI processing, etc.), you will also need
  Aaron Watters' 'kjbuckets' library for your version of Python.  See
  "Obtaining and Installing Dependencies" below if you do not already have
  the 'Interface' package or the 'kjbuckets' module.

  Note: if you have installed previous versions of PEAK or TransWarp, be
  sure to remove them before installing this one.  A lot of things have
  moved, been removed, or just plain ain't the same.


 BASIC INSTALLATION

  PEAK is distributed using the now-standard Python 'distutils' protocol.
  Just unpack the archive, go to the directory containing 'setup.py', and run::

    python setup.py install

  PEAK will be installed in the 'site-packages' directory of your Python
  installation.  (Unless directed elsewhere; see the "Installing Python 
  Modules" section of the Python manuals for details on customizing
  installation locations, etc.).






 OBTAINING AND INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES

  Aaron Watters' 'kjbuckets' Module

   See "http://gadfly.sf.net/":http://gadfly.sf.net/ for information on
   downloading and installing kjbuckets for various platforms and versions
   of Python.  For the installation, you only need to follow the part
   of the installation which is described as "If you wish to speed up gadfly,
   go to the kjbuckets directory and...".  Even if you choose to install
   the entire gadfly package, you *must* be sure to do this extra step, or
   the kjbuckets module will not be installed.

  The Zope 'Interface' Package

   PEAK now includes a (bug-fixed) version of the Zope 'Interface' package.
   It's automatically installed alongside PEAK in your 'site-packages'
   directory.  (Note that this will overwrite any existing installation of
   the 'Interface' package.)  The 'Interface' package is copyright Zope
   Corporation and Contributors; please see the 'src/Interface/LICENSE.txt'
   file for details of its license.  Modifications were made to this 
   distribution of the 'Interface' package to fix the "metaclass implements"
   bug documented at:

      "http://collector.zope.org/Zope3-dev/82":http://collector.zope.org/Zope3-dev/82















   

 TESTING YOUR INSTALLATION

  PEAK comes with a moderately-sized built-in test suite.  If you wish to
  run it after installation, you can do so like this::

   python setup.py test

  This will run about 75 tests on various parts of PEAK.  If you have
  installed everything correctly, 100% of the tests should succeed.  If
  you're missing any needed parts, you will probably be unable to run the
  tests at all.

  If you'd like to run only a portion of the test suite, you can supply
  the '--test-module' or '-m' option to the test command as follows::

    python setup.py test --test-module=peak.util.tests

    python setup.py test -m peak.api.tests

  And so on.  You can also use 'python setup.py -q test' to make the tests
  run more "quietly".
