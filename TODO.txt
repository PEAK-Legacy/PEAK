Open Issues/To-Do Items

 Targeted for 0.5 Alpha 3

    * Refactor binding and naming frameworks to

      - get rid of cruft (such as JNDI 'attrs' hangover) and duplication

      - make adaptation available for bindings (e.g. 'adaptTo=' keyword),
        including when bindings are set via kwargs in component constructor

      - streamline descriptor mechanisms used by binding and model to make them
        uniform and cleanly functional (in both senses of the word functional)

      - clean up attribute metadata framework and get rid of all the special
        cases (e.g. isinstance() checks, special attribute names, etc.)

      - add class framework for bindings so that new features like 'adaptTo'
        don't have to be added to a jillion individual binding constructors

      - make indirection convenient (e.g. bind to looking up something from
        another binding)

    * Implement "contextual protocols" (c.f. "object teams") and "parameterized
      protocols" (E.g. 'ListOf(IFoo)', 'MappingOf(keys=IBar,values=IBaz)')

    * Rough-out web publishing framework

      - Publication interfaces

      - Viewer/Controller adaptation mechanisms

 Targeted for 0.5 Beta 1

    * Up-to-date reference docstrings for all packages

    * Finish tutorial chapter 2 (?)

    * Web publishing framework sufficient to deploy page-based or object-
      published apps

 Targeted for 0.5 Final Release (or sooner)

    peak.storage

        - unit tests for more complex object scenarios: references, thunks..?

    peak.naming

        - useful example "flat" naming context (e.g. like AppUtils.URLkeys)

        - useful example hierarchical naming context (e.g. like JNDI's LDAP
          context or a filesystem context)

        - rework smtp: to return a factory object that supports open().
          Also think about whether smtp should move elsewhere. Maybe
          there should be peak.network or peak.internet for things like
          smtp, ftp, etc contexts?

        - add in Ty's cool "n2" (Namespace Navigator) shell for working with
          naming providers.


 Targeted for version 0.6

   * Get XMI writing in place, w/transaction support

   * Generate UML 1.5 and CWM 1.0 and 1.1, and add them to the
     'setup.py' package lists.

   * On-the-fly class combination (think "runtime module inheritance",
     but possibly without the modules) for DMs.

   * Lock management interfaces/API for peak.storage

   * Make 'cluster' parser complain about things that would cause
     the clusterit tools to choke or barf on the file, or which would
     produce ambiguous or unintended results.  (Or replace with ZConfig
     schema that can generate clusterit files.  And/or replace clusterit
     tools with PEAK ones.)


 Future Releases

  (Note: some of the below is held-over from TransWarp and may no longer be
  relevant as written, they are being kept on this list as placeholders for
  ideas or problem areas that may need to be re-considered in future.)

  Miscellaneous

    * Functional tests that access "real" databases, LDAP, etc.

  Simulator/Module Inheritance

    * Allow 'declareModule()' to bootstrap non-existent modules; this might
      let us create "virtual packages" made by assembling other packages and
      modules.

    * Need a strategy for handling "del" operations; they are currently
      untrapped.  This might be okay under most circumstances, but need to
      consider edge cases.

    * 'makeClass()' should probably become part of the core API, where
      it can be used to resolve __metaclass__ conflicts during the first
      pass of importing a module (prior to running 'setupModule()')


  Messaging/ObjectSpaces

    * Support for sending and receiving remote cache invalidation
      messages between DataManagers.












  peak.model

    * Implement WarpCORE-oriented structural model, w/Querying support

    * "Indexed" version of in-memory model?


    Queries

       * Refactor to use interfaces, if appropriate

       * Incorporate into AbstractModel?

         - Pros:

           * Queries always available

           * Each StructuralModel implementation can easily include its own
             performance-tuned version of the basic items.

         - Con: default implementation doesn't perform well on large datasets

       * How much of framework needs extensibility?  Should the predicate
         classes be placed in the StructuralModel's namespace so that predicates
         have their meaning assigned by the StructuralModel implementation?
















  peak.metamodels.uml

    * Helper methods in Elements & Services for marshalling, common queries, etc.

    * Generator framework

      - Tagged values in stereotypes vs. main values?

      - Should tagged values be copied directly into templates?  Treated as
        Python expressions?

      - Should Services be generated using an Element class' "static"
        (class-scope) methods/attributes?

        - Are association-ends scoped?

        - Would it be better to seperate them?

      - What determines whether an implemented Service actually stores objects
        or delegates this to its subclass services?

    * Simple Zope product demo (upload XMI, then browse the model via the web)
