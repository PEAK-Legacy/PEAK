"""The TransWarp Software Automation Framework

The base package imports all the "kernel" objects and methods, so that you
don't have to refer to things like 'TW.Interfaces.IBuilder' or
'TW.Components.build'.  Instead, 'TW.build' or 'from TW import build' suffices.

The current kernel modules are 'TW.Interfaces', 'TW.Components', and
'TW.Builders' - any public item available directly from them is available here.
