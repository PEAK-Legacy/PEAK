"""Working with object (meta)models akin to the OMG Meta-Object Facility (MOF)

    What little there is in this package is currently off-line, due to changes
    in the fundamental assumptions of how TransWarp deals with metamodels.  It
    will likely be some time before updating it becomes a priority for me; my
    near-future development emphasis is on practical applications of TransWarp
    (especially database-related) using hand-coded metadata and models
    expressed in Python code.

    Someday, however, I will be back in this territory again, and perhaps by then
    the MOF 1.4 spec will have landed as a practical standard (rather than
    just an announced one), which would make the task of filling out this package
    a good deal easier!  (MOF 1.4 drops a lot of CORBA junk out, and its
    metametamodel is capable of representing itself using only itself, if that
    makes sense, and if I haven't misremembered anything - it's been far too long
    since I worked on this stuff.)
