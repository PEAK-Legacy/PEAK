PEAK "Bulletins" Example

 "Bulletins" is a simple web-based announcements application written with
 PEAK, Zope X3, and SQLite.  (Or at least, it will be, once it's finished.)
 The idea is to serve as a simple illustration of techniques such as 
 "executable configuration" and object-relational mapping with 'peak.storage'
 data managers.
