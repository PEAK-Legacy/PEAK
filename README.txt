TransWarp Preview Release 0.1
Copyright (C) 2001 Phillip J. Eby, All rights reserved.
This software may be used under the same terms as Zope or Python.

Please see http://www.zope.org/Members/pje/Wikis/TransWarp for tutorials,
FAQs, package layout, etc.

At this time, the 'Features', 'Aspects', 'SOX', and 'tests' modules
and packages are usable, if not necessarily full-featured.

All other modules/packages (except as imported by the above) are
under heavy construction - don't enter without a hard hat!  (That is,
use them at your own risk.  Although, there's no warranty that any of
the other stuff works, beyond the fact that the tests run on my
home computer.)
