 Package Description

    TransWarp is a toolkit for software automation in Python, where the term
    "software automation" is considered to include CASE, code templating,
    metaprogramming, generative programming, subject- and aspect-oriented
    programming, etc.  It is also a collection of frameworks which use the
    toolkit for integration with applications and other frameworks.

    As Zope is to web publishing, as Twisted Python is to internet protocols,
    and as AnyGUI is to graphical user interfaces, so TransWarp is (or wants
    to be) to the guts of your application, whatever its external interface.

    The high-level vision of TransWarp is "Metadata + Metaclasses = Programs".
