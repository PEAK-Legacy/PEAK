Fixes and Enhancements since Version 0.5 alpha 1

 - Fixed 'mof2py' generator script not working

 - Fixed model.Element not getting parent component set when passed as a
   constructor argument.

 - Fixed property/utility lookups not working correctly on model.*
   objects.

 - Fixed IndentedStream generating all-whitespace lines

 - Made 'NOT_GIVEN' and 'NOT_FOUND' recognizable by humans (they 'repr'
   and 'str' to their names) and by Python (they can be pickled, and
   when restored they come back as the same object).
