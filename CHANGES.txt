New Features and Bug Fixes since v0.2, preview 1

 * Added 'SEF.bindToParent()' and 'SEF.bindToNames()' specifiers to allow
   more flexible component parameter bindings.

 * Fixed the base class "rebind by name" bugs in module inheritance, and
   updated the documentation to more clearly reflect what it is that
   metaclass generation and module inheritance does and does not do.  Added
   test cases to prevent regression of the rebind-by-name problem.

 * The 'setup.py' script features a new command, 'happy', which can be used
   to generate the API reference docs, and this command runs as part of the
   'sdist' command to build source distributions.

 * The API reference docs in the source distribution has been moved from
   the 'doc' directory to 'docs/html/reference'.

 * Added 'CHANGES.txt' file.
