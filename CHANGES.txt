Fixes and Enhancements since Version 0.5 alpha 1

 - Added 'binding.metamethod()' wrapper for metaclass methods that might
   not be accessible from their instances if the instances (classes) also
   defined the method for *their* instances.  You must now use this wrapper
   on any such metaclass-defined methods, as PEAK no longer works around
   this via the 'x.__class__.foo(x,...)' trick that was used previously.
   In particular, if you have metaclass definitions of 'getParentComponent',
   '_getConfigData', 'getComponentName', or 'notifyUponAssembly', you need
   to wrap them with 'binding.metamethod' now.

 - Fixed 'mof2py' generator script not working

 - Fixed model.Element not getting parent component set when passed as a
   constructor argument.

 - Fixed property/utility lookups not working correctly on model.*
   objects.

 - Fixed IndentedStream generating all-whitespace lines

 - Made 'NOT_GIVEN' and 'NOT_FOUND' recognizable by humans (they 'repr'
   and 'str' to their names) and by Python (they can be pickled, and
   when restored they come back as the same object).
